Then, add TitleManager as a dependency to your plugin.yml file:\r\n````yml\r\ndepend: [TitleManager]\r\n````\r\nAlternatively, you can add as a soft dependency `softdepend: [TitleManager]` if you can live without it.\r\nAnother alternative would be to check for the plugin within `onEnable()` inside of your Main class:\r\n````java\r\n@Override\r\npublic void onEnable() {\r\n  if (getServer().getPluginManager().getPlugin(\"TitleManager\") != null && getServer().getPluginManager().getPlugin(\"TitleManager\").isEnabled())\r\n    getLogger().info(\"Successfully hooked into TitleManager!\");\r\n  else {\r\n    getLogger().warning(\"Failed to hook into TitleManager, disabling plugin!\");\r\n    getPluginLoader().disablePlugin(this);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n````\r\nNow you should be good to go and ready to use the API inside of your plugins!\r\n\r\n### The Objects\r\n__TitleManager__ provides you with three objects, one being `TitleObject.java` which controls everything to do with the floating messages on your screen, and the second being `TabTitleObject.java` which controls everything to do with the header and footer on the Tabmenu (aka the playerlist) and last but not least `ActionbarTitleObject.java` which controls everything to do with Actionbar titles, like sending an actionbar title.\r\n\r\n* [Title Object](https://github.com/Puharesource/TitleManager/wiki/api-title)\r\n* [Tabmenu Object](https://github.com/Puharesource/TitleManager/wiki/api-tab)\r\n* [Actionbar Title Object](https://github.com/Puharesource/TitleManager/wiki/api-actionbar)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
